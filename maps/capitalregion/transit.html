        <h2>Getting in and around the Capital Region</h2>
        <h3>Getting in</h3>
        <p>The easiest way to get in the Capital Region is by Air Travel. pennAir has a hub at the Bird City-Maneka Grove International Airport (BCM Airport) that operates many flights to places like Lucius and Birdburg South Airport. AirBudgie also has a couple of flights to and from the BCM airport, to places like San Jacinto. flySky also operates flights from the Bird City Central Airport, to all other airports in the Capital Region and to Birdburg North Airport. Other fights are operated out of Chicago and Westford.</p>
        <h3>Getting Around</h3>
        <p>No matter where you are, there will always be a bus. At every metro station in Bird City, there is at least one bus service and at every airport in the Capital Region there is at least one bus. If you would like to get around the Capital Region quickly, the easiest way is by train. If you would like to get around a city in the Capital Region; you can take the bus. However, in Bird City, we operate 8 metro lines (Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, Pink, Brown.) as well as 2 tram lines (Y, Z.) In Westford we operate 6 (a 7th one coming soon) Tram Lines (A, B, C, D, E, F, and soon to be G.) In Chicago we operate 4 trolleybus lines, (500, 501, 502, 503.) If you need to get from 1 Capital Region to the other very quickly, you can always take a helicopter or fly with flySky.</p>
