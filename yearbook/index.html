        <h2>I'm Arlo.</h2>
        <p>I'm a freshman on the Thomas Worthington High School's yearbook team. My task is to take photos, design spreads, and help plan the yearbook.</p>
        <h3>Things I've done:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Designed a spread on Boys Cross Country</li>
          <li>Gone to events to take photos for other yearbook staff to use</li>
          <li>Interviewed Cross Country players for my spread</li>
        </ul>

          <h3>Lock In</h3>
          <p>Junior Wesley Nash speeds along the crowd with determination to cross over the finish line before a Dublin Coffman runner at the Eisenhart on October 4. “I just really, really wanted to catch that guy and I just really wanted to catch as many people as I can” said Nash.</p>
          <p><small>Camera: Canon EOS R50, F-stop: 5.6, Shutter speed: 1/500, Edited: Yes</small></p>
          <p><small>This photo wasn't a lot of work to do. I just simply waited by the finish line to get the shot. This ended up becoming my best shot from that quarter of the school year. I really tried to capture Nash's emotion in the shot, as I thought it would be a pretty nice photo to have.</small></p>

          <h3>Stampede</h3>
          <p>A group of Thomas Worthington High School runners go along the Eisenhart course on October 4th. The runners (from left to right) are Senior Fraser Kirk, Junior Owen Cunningham, Junior Wesley Nash, and Freshman Riley Greco. The Eisenhart is usually a very big event throughout the season, especially for TWHS runners, considering the fact that it’s their home course. “It takes like two weeks to put up. And then teardown, it’s an all-day event. There are meets going from nine in the morning to one in the afternoon. We got food trucks. The New Balance Athlete, the vendors, like Fleet Feet come out and sell shoes,” said Kirk.</p>
          <p><small>Camera: Canon EOS R50, F-stop: 11, Shutter speed: 1/500, Edited: Yes</small></p>
          <p><small>This photo I didn't have to do much work either. For pretty much the entire event I just walked around to where I knew runners were going to be and I just took a photo every time I saw a runner from my school. I think this photo was really nice because I could capture a lot of people at once, thus showing how big the event is and how many people show up.</small></p>

          <h3>The Bridge</h3>
          <p style="max-width: 285px;">Sophomore Owen Rings runs the trail under OH-161 at the Eisenhart on October 4th.</p>
          <p style="max-width: 285px;"><small>Camera: Canon EOS R50, F-stop: 7.1, Shutter speed: 1/1000, Edited: Yes</small></p>
          <p style="max-width: 285px;"><small>This shot was a little bit more of a challenge. The cross country course went under a bridge on OH-161, thus I didn't have a lot of natural lighting, so I had to lower my aperture to get the lighting.</small></p>

          <h3>Around The Corners</h3>
          <p>Freshman Austin Battig gets a move on on October 4th at the Eisenhart.</p>
          <p><small>Camera: Canon EOS R50, F-stop: 7.1, Shutter speed: 1/1000, Edited: Yes</small></p>
          <p><small>I feel lke this photo was very in-the-moment. It captured the speed that the runner was running at, on top of the emotion that the photo was conveying.</small></p>

          <h3>Fraternity</h3>
          <p>Freshman Evan Hiss (right) and Sophomore Porter Greene (left) run side-by-side during the Eisenhart on October 4th. Some might say that Cross Country is a team sport amidst the fact that everyone runs for their own PR (personal record). “I’d say, yeah, it's like a team sport. You are trying to do your best as a team, but personal PRs push you as well, because as you're trying to push to get faster and faster, you're helping the team,” said Greene.</p>

          <h3>Long Way 'Round</h3>
          <p>This is my very <strong>first spread</strong> that I made. It focuses on the Boys Cross Country team at Thomas Worthington High School in Worthington, Ohio. I went with that photo as my primary because it was definitely my favorite from all of the photos I took and it really captured what it's like to be in Cross Country. I went with "Long Way 'Round" as the title because I had looked at the cross country spreads from previous years and thought, "Why not do something else?" Some 'feature quotes' (as I like to call them) were added in because I had gotten some really good quotes out of some people but I didn't have a photo of them to pair it with. I felt like giving everyone's words a chance, so that's why they're there. Overall, I tried to capture Cross Country as an experience compared to a sport. I also tried to describe the sport to people who don't know much about the sport or sports in general, like me.</p>
