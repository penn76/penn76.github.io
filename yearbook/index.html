        <h2>I'm Arlo.</h2>
        <p>I'm a freshman on the Thomas Worthington High School's yearbook team. My task is to take photos, design spreads, and help plan the yearbook. I have worked on spreads for Boys Cross Country, and I am currently working on a spread about my school's new spaces that are opening amongst all of the construction.</p>

          <p>Junior Wesley Nash speeds along the crowd with determination to cross over the finish line before a Dublin Coffman runner at the Eisenhart on October 4. “I just really, really wanted to catch that guy and I just really wanted to catch as many people as I can” said Nash.</p>

          <p>A group of Thomas Worthington High School runners go along the Eisenhart course on October 4th. The runners (from left to right) are Senior Fraser Kirk, Junior Owen Cunningham, Junior Wesley Nash, and Freshman Riley Greco. The Eisenhart is usually a very big event throughout the season, especially for TWHS runners, considering the fact that it’s their home course. “It takes like two weeks to put up. And then teardown, it’s an all-day event. There are meets going from nine in the morning to one in the afternoon. We got food trucks. The New Balance Athlete, the vendors, like Fleet Feet come out and sell shoes,” said Kirk.</p>

          <p>Freshman Evan Hiss (right) and Sophomore Porter Greene (left) run side-by-side during the Eisenhart on October 4th. Some might say that Cross Country is a team sport amidst the fact that everyone runs for their own PR (personal record). “I’d say, yeah, it's like a team sport. You are trying to do your best as a team, but personal PRs push you as well, because as you're trying to push to get faster and faster, you're helping the team,” said Greene.</p>
