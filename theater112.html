      <h3>What is Theater112?</h3>
      <p>Theater112 is your all-in-one media center for your Mac, integrating your music, movies, and videos. If you have used macOS Tiger through Snow Leopard, you might have known an app called Front Row. This is the new Front Row. Oh yeah, and a fun fact: this app was developed by a 14-year-old.</p>
      <h3>Okay, great! How I download it?</h3>
      <p>Go up to the top of the screen. You see that "Downloads" button there? Click it. You can download versions of Theater112 there.</p>
      <h3>Apple gives me an error that the app couldn't verify the app for malware.</h3>
      <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102445">View this article from Apple to fix this.</a>
      <h3>What are the minimum system requirements?</h3>
      <p>You'll need macOS 11 Big Sur or later to run this app. We do not have other hardware to test.</p>
